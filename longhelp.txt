  PURPOSE:

   The JPL Horizons On-Line Ephemeris System provides easy access to key solar
system data and flexible production of highly accurate ephemerides for solar
system objects. This includes 536,000+ asteroids, 3000 comets, 170 natural
satellites, all planets, the Sun, 60+ spacecraft, and several dynamical points
such as Earth-Sun L1, L2, L4, L5, and system barycenters. Users may also define 
their own objects, then use the system to integrate the trajectory, or conduct 
parameter searches of the comet/asteroid database, searching on combinations of 
up to 42 different parameters. Rise, transit and set may be identified to the 
nearest minute. Close-approaches by asteroids and comets to planetary bodies 
(and Ceres, Pallas, and Vesta) can be rapidly identified along with the 
encounter uncertainties and impact probabilities. Orbit uncertainties can be 
computed for asteroids and comets.

   More than 100 different observational and physical aspect quantities can be
requested at intervals for both topocentric and geocentric situations in one
of 9 coordinate systems and 4 time scales (CT, TT, UT, Civil). Over 1500 Earth
station locations are on file, along with several on other major bodies, in 
addition to spacecraft "observer sites". Users may search for or define 
topocentric site coordinates on any planet or natural satellite (with known 
rotational model), if the desired site is not predefined.  Output is suitable 
for observers, mission planners and other researchers, although this 
determination is ultimately the users' responsibility.

   Five types of customizable output can be requested:
 
       1) Observables (RA/DEC, Az/El, physical aspect, angles, etc.)
       2) Osculating elements
       3) Cartesian state vectors
       4) Close approaches to planets (and Ceres, Pallas, and Vesta)
       5) SPK binaries (asteroids and comets only)

   The first four are ASCII tables. Output is returned to the user via e-mail,
FTP or Kermit protocols. Table output can be requested in a format suitable for
spreadsheet import. SPK file output allows user programs to reproduce the
integrated target state at any instant. The SPK files can be used by existing 
visualization, animation and mission-design software.

   The underlying planet/satellite ephemerides and small-body osculating
elements are the same ones used at JPL for radar astronomy, mission planning 
and spacecraft navigation.

  OVERVIEW OF USAGE:

   There are three different ways to access the program:

   A) Telnet (full access, active interactive prompt-based interface):
        1)  Telnet directly to the system (telnet ssd.jpl.nasa.gov 6775). 
            No account or password is required.
        2)  Specify an object to get a summary data screen. 
        3)  Follow prompts. At any prompt, type ? or ?! for short or long 
            explanations
        4)  Transmit results to your system by e-mail, FTP or Kermit

   B) E-mail (full access, except for SPK file production, batch interface):
        1) Send e-mail to "horizons@ssd.jpl.nasa.gov" w/subject "BATCH-LONG".
        2) An example command file will be mailed back to you.
        3) Edit this text file, then mail it back with the subject header "JOB"
        4) Results of your request are mailed back to you.

   C) Web (partial access, passive interactive GUI interface):
        Point your browser to http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons.html

   The Horizons system was intended to be easy to use and should have a 
step-function learning curve. The remainder of this documentation summarizes 
system capabilities, but is not necessary for successful use.  

   While using the telnet system, type "?" or "?!" at any prompt for an 
explanation of options. See "Acknowledgements" section for contact information.

===============================================================================
                         CONNECTING TO THE SYSTEM   

TELNET:

   The Horizons on-line ephemeris and data system is available as a telnet 
service. This is suitable for people who want full access to all program 
features in an interactive prompt-based way. From a telnet-capable machine,
running a "VT100" type terminal emulation, telnet to "ssd.jpl.nasa.gov 6775":  

From UNIX command line:

    telnet ssd.jpl.nasa.gov 6775

... where 6775 is a port number. Alternatively, from within a web-browser, 
enter the URL:
  
    telnet://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov:6775". 

   The system will start a terminal session automatically. No user-ID or 
password is required.  If your connection is refused, there are two possible
causes:

    A. The port number wasn't specified or passed along. A few PC-type telnet 
        programs do not to fully implement the telnet protocol and may not 
        pass the port number to the network, or may need to be reconfigured
        to function properly or may have a different syntax for specifying port
        numbers. Consult your user's guide for information.

    B. Firewall/security restriction at your end. Please contact your local 
        computer system administrator in this case. Since no password or 
        security information is exchanged, you may be able to request a
        firewall exception from your institution.

   Once you connect, the system will attempt to determine your window size. If 
it cannot, it will default to a 24 row by 79 column screen display. If this is 
inappropriate, and your display paging is choppy, manually set your screen size 
by using the command "TTY {rows} {columns}", where {rows} and {columns} are 
replaced by appropriate integers. 

   Window sizes less than 79 columns aren't recommended since data-screen 
displays are formatted with that minimum size in mind and will be difficult to 
read on something smaller. 

   Access may be automated. Example scripts may be found in the anonymous FTP 
directory "ftp://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/ssd", and include "smb_spk", "obs_tbl" 
(with sample input file "obs_tbl.inp"), and "osc_tbl" (with sample input file 
"osc_tbl.inp").

WEB:

   Point your browser to http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons.html. This graphical 
interface is intended for the more casual user or general public and now offers 
access to most (but not all) program features using pull-down menus, fill-in 
boxes and buttons to click. Verify default settings for time and coordinate 
systems are as intended for the run.

E-MAIL:

   The program can also be controlled by sending e-mail messages to the address
"horizons@ssd.jpl.nasa.gov". Response is determined by the subject of the 
message. This option is for those who want access to most program features 
without the overhead of answering prompts or manipulating graphical interfaces;
generally those already familiar with what the program does and who know what 
they want.  It has the additional capability of allowing users to specify up to 
10000 discrete times (to aid astrometric reduction) and up to 200 objects at 
once. It does not allow SPK file production available via telnet.

   To get started, send e-mail to the above address with the subject
"BATCH-LONG". The latest, fully-commented example run-stream will be
mailed back. Edit this file to produce the results you want, then mail back
with the subject "JOB". Acceptable e-mail subject commands are:

                            GENERAL DEFINITIONS

  The remainder of this document uses these abbreviations and terms. 
Understanding their meaning will help you properly interpret program
documentation and output.
 
RA 
   Right ascension; the angular distance on the celestial sphere eastward along 
the celestial equator from the reference equinox to the meridian of the object.
RA is analogous to longitude, with the plane containing the equinox defining 
zero RA much as the Greenwich meridian defines zero longitude.  Expressed in 
units of hours, minutes and seconds or degrees, as requested.
 
DEC
    Declination; the angular distance on the celestial sphere north (positive) 
or south (negative) of the celestial equator. It is analogous to latitude. 
Usually expressed in degrees.
 
AZ
   Azimuth; the angle measured eastward along the "horizon" (the plane 
perpendicular to the local zenith) from the North to the point where the 
meridian passing through local zenith and the object intersects the horizon 
plane.
 
EL
   Elevation; the angular distance above or below the plane perpendicular to 
the local zenith. Note this plane is not necessarily the visible horizon, due 
to station elevation ("horizon dip" effect).

Geometric coordinates
   Referred to the mean equator and equinox of a particular reference frame
(ICRF or FK4/B1950.0). Geometric coordinates are the true, or instantaneous 
states of a body at a particular ephemeris time.

Astrometric coordinates
   Accounts for the finite but varying amount of time it takes light to 
travel from the target to the observer and is expressed with respect to the 
mean equator and equinox of a particular reference frame (ICRF or FK4/B1950.0).

Apparent coordinates
   Takes into account factors which appear to change target position with 
respect to the background stars and inertial coordinate system: light-time, 
stellar aberration, the relativistic deflection of light. Usually, a final 
rotation to some "of-date" coordinate system is performed, such as 
precession-nutation to the Earth's true-equator and equinox-of-date. 

Refracted coordinates
   Apparent coordinates approximately corrected for atmospheric refraction.
Available only for Earth-based sites.
 
Small body
   Refers to a comet or asteroid for which the trajectory is integrated from 
orbital elements. Typically no cartographic coordinate system is available, 
with the exceptions, so far, being Gaspra and Ida.
 
Major body
   Refers to a planet, natural satellite, spacecraft or the Sun.  
Only major bodies can be coordinate centers (observing sites). In special 
cases, a comet or asteroid can be redefined as a "major body", such as a
spacecraft encounter, where it is desirable to generate an ephemeris of 
the approaching spacecraft as seen from the target.  State vectors are 
interpolated from previously defined ephemerides, such as DE-405, which 
are stored as Chebyshev coefficients. Interpolation recovers the state 
the mm level.
 
Target body
   Refers to the object of interest, selected by the user. It can be a 
major-body or small-body.
 
Primary body
   Refers to closest body about which a target body orbits.  For natural 
satellites, this would be a planet, although they orbit the Sun as well. For 
planets and small-bodies, the primary body is the Sun.
 
===============================================================================
                               OBJECT SELECTION

After connecting by telnet, the primary thing one has to learn to to use 
Horizons effectively is how to select objects. You will be prompted for
everything else. 

  There are two categories of objects to select:

     1. MAJOR BODIES ... defined as planets, natural satellites, spacecraft,
                          and "special cases"

     2. SMALL BODIES ... comets and asteroids.  

  This division is a result of the objects being stored differently as far
as the system is concerned. Major bodies are represented in pre-computed
trajectory files which are interpolated very accurately to retrieve position 
and velocity at any instant.  Small-bodies have their position and velocity 
at one instant compactly stored in a database and are then numerically 
integrated "on-the-fly" by Horizons to other times of interest (also very 
accurately), using all known physics.

  When an object is specified, the request is first examined for "keywords" 
that tell the system more about what is wanted. If there aren't any keywords, 
the system will then try to match against the major body list. If no match
is found among the major bodies, it will then match against the small-body 
database.

  For example, if you simply input "Io", it will return a list of matches from
among the major bodies, including the moon of Jupiter, and then stop, waiting
for a unique specification that matches just one object. To uniquely specify
Io, enter it's IAU number, "501", which was displayed on the previous list
of multiple matches. 

  To instead select the small-body named Io, provide more information by 
specifying it one of these ways: 
  
   Horizons> Io;        (semi-colon tells Horizons its a small-body look-up) 
   Horizons> 85         (no match on major body [at least right now], so 
                         search "falls through" to small-body number look-up)
   Horizons> 85;        (semi-colon tells Horizons its a small-body look-up)
   Horizons> NAME= Io   (Keyword "NAME" tells Horizons its an asteroid or 
                         comet small-body look-up)
   Horizons> ASTNAM= Io (Keyword "ASTNAM" tells Horizons its an asteroid 
                         name)

  Further details, discussion, and examples follow.


MAJOR BODIES
~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Type 'MB' to get a list of all major-body strings that can be used to search
on.  To select a major body, enter one of the following:

     (1)  A string to search on ("Mars" or "Trit"). Case insensitive.
     (2)  A JPL ID integer code or fragment
     (3)  An IAU code 

Examples (at the main prompt):

     Horizons> mars bary (uniquely select Mars center; '4' does the same)
     Horizons> mars      (list all major bodies with 'mars' in an ID field)
     Horizons> 501       (uniquely select Io)
     Horizons> N*        (list all major bodies with 'n' in an ID field)

  Major planets may have two integer ID's assigned. Those >100, ending in 
99 (such as 199, 299, 399, etc.) refer to planet CENTERS. To select planet 
SYSTEM BARYCENTERS, use the codes less than 10 (1, 2, 3). For example, "399"
is the Earth's center, '3' is the Earth-Moon Barycenter and "301" is the 
center of the Moon. For Mercury, Venus and Mars, there is no significant 
difference between planet-center and system barycenter (1=199, 2=299, 4=499,
as far as Horizons selection is concerned).

  If a planet name is entered, it may not be considered unique if a distinct
system barycenter is present. For example, if "Saturn" is entered, a list
containing "Saturn" and the "Saturn Barycenter" will be returned. To specify 
Saturn (the planet-center), you must use its unique ID code, "699". 

  System barycenters are available over longer time-spans than planet-centers 
because planet-centers are defined by satellite solutions. These satellite 
solutions are based on shorter data arcs than the entire system and can 
therefore be extrapolated only over shorter time-spans. For example, the
planet Jupiter (599) might be available over the interval 1600-2500, while 
the Jupiter system barycenter (5) is available over 3000 B.C. to A.D. 3000.


SMALL BODIES
~~~~~~~~~~~~
  To select an asteroid or comet, enter a list of parameters to search on
SEPARATED BY A SEMI-COLON (;).  TYPE 'SB' FOR LIST OF 42 FIELD KEYWORDS THAT 
CAN BE MATCHED, or see list later in this document. Match symbols are from the 
set { >, <, <>, = }. 

  For example,  "A < 2.5; IN > 7.8; STYP = S, GM <> 0; " searches for all 
S-type small-bodies with semi-major axis less than 2.5 AU and inclination 
greater than 7.8 degrees with a known (non-zero) GM. Spaces in the command are
not considered, nor are upper/lower-case distinctions.

  Exceptions are object names and designations. Name searches consider spaces.
Designation searches consider spaces AND upper/lower-case. If you want to match
a fragment of a name or designation, end it with a '*' (e.g. DES = 1993*;). 
Otherwise, it is assumed a complete name or designation is specified and the
search must match exactly and completely. 

  For example:
 
        NAME = CERES;    (matches only if object name is "Ceres")
        NAME = CER*;     (match "Ceres", "Lucerna", "Cicero", etc.) 

  The same keyword can be used more than once in a search command. For example,
"IN >10; IN < 20;" will list those objects possessing an inclination between
10 and 20 degrees. If the directive "LIST;" is in the search request, the 
matched parameters will be displayed. For example, "IN > 150; LIST" will 
display the inclination of each object with inclination greater than 150
degrees.

  Once a small-body is uniquely identified, a screen of data will be displayed.
If more than one small-body matches given parameters, a list of matching 
objects is displayed.  Individual objects from the matched list can then be 
requested by giving the displayed "record number", followed by a semi-colon.

  The semi-colon is used to indicate a small-body request and resolve
number ambiguities. For example, entering '1' will select Mercury Barycenter.  
Enter '1;' to retrieve the small-body in record #1 (Ceres).

  Osculating elements for more than one comet apparition may be listed 
("apparition" refers to a particular perihelion passage), since out-gassing 
near perihelion can alter the orbit for each passage.  Select an apparition 
from the list with the closest epoch prior to the date of interest for the 
ephemeris, or add the "CAP" directive to the search to  automatically select 
the closest apparition of interest:

     CAP;         (return last apparition before current date)
     CAP < JD#;   (return last apparition before specified Julian Day Number)
     CAP < YEAR;  (return last apparition before given integer year)

   If the number after a '<' is less than 10000, it is assumed to be a year 
integer.  Otherwise, the number is taken to be a Julian Day Number. If "CAP;"
is specified, the search is automatically recognized as being a comets-only 
search.

  The record (or file) number of unnumbered asteroids and comet apparitions 
should NOT be considered constants; they WILL change as the database is updated.
 
  To enter your own heliocentric ecliptic elements, type ";". This capability
is described in more detail in a later section.

  Example queries follow. Where more than one example is given, the first
is most likely to complete as intended.  For example, "ASTNAM = Vesta;"
will always return the asteroid while, if you use the convenient form "Vesta", 
it's possible that a future natural satellite name will someday include that 
string and there will no longer be a unique match. A good habit might be
to include at least one semi-colon in all small-body searches to be clear 
when you are looking for a comet or asteroid.

 Search for objects matching a set of parameters:
   Horizons> A < 2.5; IN > 7.8; STYP = S; GM <> 0;       (asteroid & comets)
   Horizons> A < 2.5; IN > 7.8; STYP = S; GM <> 0; AST;  (asteroids only)
   Horizons> A < 2.5; IN > 7.8; STYP = S; GM <> 0; COM;  (comets only)

 Match by name:
   Horizons> ASTNAM= Vesta;
   Horizons> Vesta;
   Horizons> Vesta

 Match by name fragment:
   Horizons> NAME= all*;
   Horizons> all*;
 
 "Wildcard" match designation:
   Horizons> DES = 1993*; (Objects with designations containing 1993)
   Horizons> 1993*;
   Horizons> 1993*

  NOTE: The '*' must be at the end. It toggles searches on sub-strings of
        characters and is not a true positional wildcard. For example,
        '19*3;' is not a recognized search.

 Match exact designation:
   Horizons> DES= 1990 MU;
   Horizons> 1990 MU;
   Horizons> 1990 MU

 Select numbered asteroid:
   Horizons> 1;                    (Object in database record #1 ["1 Ceres"])

 Define an arbitrary object not in database
   Horizons> ;            

 Comet searches:
   Horizons> COMNAM= HER*;         (Comet names (only) containing "her")
   Horizons> DES= 73P;             (Request comet 73P apparitions, including
                                    fragments, if any)
   Horizons> DES= 73P; NOFRAG      (Request apparitions of comet 73P,
                                    excluding fragments)   
   Horizons> DES= 73P; CAP         (Request comet 73P apparition solution
                                    closest to present date, including any 
                                    fragments)
   Horizons> DES= 73P; NOFRAG; CAP (Request comet 73P apparition solution 
                                    closest to present date, excluding any 
                                    fragments)
   Horizons> COM; NOFRAG; CAP      (List the apparition solutions closest to
                                    to the present date for all comets, 
                                    excluding fragments)
   Horizons> NAME=Halley;CAP<1690; (Request last Halley apparition prior to 
                                     the year 1690)

===============================================================================

                   COORDINATE CENTER (OBSERVING SITE) SELECTION

While osculating element tables may be generated with respect to a major body
center only, vector and observer tables may produce output with respect to an
arbitrary observing site, defined with respect to a major body center.

EARTH SITES
-----------

  For the Earth, a list of 1500+ sites is predefined. The list generally matches
that of the Minor Planet Center while expanding on radar sites (which have 
negative ID numbers on this system) as necessary. Station "500" is the geocenter.

NON-EARTH SITES
---------------

  For non-Earth major bodies, station 500 also represents the body center.
For those major bodies with IAU rotational models, additional topocentric sites
may be defined. Spacecraft landing sites are typically predefined on non-Earth
bodies.

USING A PREDEFINED SITE
-----------------------
 
  There are several equivalent ways of specifying a location. The most 
general form is ...

                                 site @ body 

  ... where "site" is a numeric code or name fragment to match, and "body" is
a numeric major body code or name fragment to match. A list of such major body
codes follows later in this document. 

  Here are four equivalent ways of searching for the same Earth location:

     Code         Meaning
     -----------  -------------------------------------------------------------
     675@399      Site #675 on Earth (Palomar Mountain)
     palomar@399         "
     675@                "
     Palomar             "           (observer table only)

OBSERVER & VECTOR TABLES:
  If an observer or vector table has been requested, the "@" symbol may be 
dropped; the Earth will be assumed if an integer like "675" or a name 
fragment like "Palom" is input. However, if you are trying to specify an 
observing site not on Earth, you MUST use the "@" symbol for correct 
interpretation. For example, if an observer table as seen from the Sun is
desired, it must be specified as "@10" or "@sun". Specifying "10" only will
select the Caussols site.

ELEMENT TABLES:
  For an osculating element table, the DIFFERENT assumption is made that a 
coordinate center request lacking a "@" symbol is a major body. For example,
'10' would mean the Caussols site for an observer or vector table, but 
"Sun" for a vector table.  '10@' or '10@399' would mean the Caussols site 
for both table types. 

    The different assumptions are meant to be efficient for the particular 
types of output requested, expediting "typical" usage. However, the full form
"site @ body" can always be used to avoid having to remember "quirks".

    If your specification returns more than one possible match, the list of 
matched sites is returned. Refine your site request to be more specific, by 
using the numeric codes listed, for example, and try again. 

    While one can spell out the names of the bodies and sites, it is possible 
unique matches won't be returned. Thus, use the unique ID numbers when known.  
For example, "675@Earth" will first look for the body, match both the Earth & 
Earth-Moon barycenter, thus have to quit before finding specific Palomar site 
coordinates. "675@399" is unique and avoids this problem. Spaces & upper/lower 
case are ignored.

    Here are examples for sites on bodies other than the Earth:

     Code         Meaning
     ------------ -------------------------------------------------------------
     Viking@499   List all defined Viking lander sites on Mars
     Viking 1@499 Select Viking 1 landing site on Mars
     1 @301       Site #1 on the Moon
     500 @ 501    Io body center
     3 @ 499      Site #3 on Mars 

    The asterisk ('*') can be used to generate lists:

     Code         Meaning
     ------------ -------------------------------------------------------------
       *@301      List all predefined sites on the Moon
       *@Phobos   List all predefined sites on the Martian moon Phobos
       *@399      List all predefined sites on Earth
       *@         List all predefined sites on Earth (observer/vector table)
       *          List all predefined sites on Earth (observer/vector table)
       *          List all major bodies (element table only)
     
    There are a several ways to request a body-centered site for a major body. 
 
     Code         Meaning
     ------------ -------------------------------------------------------------
     500@601      Mimas body center 
     geo@601            " 
       g@601            " 
       g@Mimas          "
     500@Deimos   Deimos body center
     geo          Earth Geocenter
       g@399      Earth Geocenter     


INPUT OF TOPOCENTRIC SITE COORDINATES
-------------------------------------

    For sites with IAU rotation models, topocentric sites may be input by the
user as follows:

     Code         Meaning
     ------------ -------------------------------------------------------------
      c @ Europa  Request prompting for user location on satellite Europa
     coord @ 502  (same) 

    The following satellites DO NOT have rotation models, thus do not support
topocentric site definition. Only body-centered observers can be defined:

         Jupiter:
            Himalia (506), Elara (507), Pasiphae (508), Sinope (509), 
            Lysithea (510), Carme (511), Ananke (512), Leda (512)

         Saturn
            Hyperion (607)

         Uranus
            Caliban (716), Sycorax(717)

         Neptune
            Nereid (802)

    After coordinate input is requested, the site location may be entered
as either geodetic or cylindrical coordinate triplets, separated by commas:

              GEODETIC (generally this means map coordinates)
                  E-long - Geodetic east longitude (DEGREES)
                  lat    - Geodetic latitude  (DEGREES)
                  h      - Altitude above reference ellipsoid (km)

              CYLINDRICAL
                  E-long - Angle eastward from XZ plane      (DEGREES)
                  DXY    - Distance from Z axis              (KM)
                  DZ     - Height above XY equator plane     (KM)

    This system always uses planetographic/geodetic coordinates. This is 
typically the one used on maps, such as those by the USGS, unless the map says
otherwise. In these coordinates, the rotational pole of the body that lies on 
the positive (north) side of the invariable plane of the solar system (the 
plane perpendicular to the solar system's angular momentum vector) is called 
the "north pole".

    Northern latitudes are positive, southern are negative. The planetographic
latitude takes into account body oblateness and, for a point on the surface, 
is the angle between the body equatorial plane and the normal to the reference 
surface at that point. For a point not on the reference surface, the geodetic
latitude is the latitude of the point on the reference surface where the normal
passes through the point at some altitude (h) above the reference surface. 

    Prograde (or direct) rotation of a body is rotation eastward, or counter-
clockwise, as seen from the north pole. For such bodies, east longitude is 
measured negatively to the east (0 to -360 degrees) from the prime meridian. 
Retrograde rotation is rotation clockwise (westward) as seen from the north 
pole. East longitude is measured positively to the east (0 to 360 degrees) 
from the prime meridian.

    Exceptions are the Earth, Moon and Sun where longitude has historically 
been measured both east and west of the prime meridian 0 to 180 degrees. Though
these bodies are direct rotators, longitude is nonetheless measured positively
to the east on this system, 0 to 360 degrees, due to historical precedence. If
the positive west longitude of a site on these 3 bodies is given, it should be
input here as positive east longitude, which would be (360 - West Longitude). 
If the negative east longitude is given instead, for these exceptions only,
one can input the negative east longitude. It will be converted to a positive
east longitude on output, however. 

    The following major bodies are either retrograde or exceptions and require
site input with positive east longitude:

       Retrograde (+ east longitude):
       ------------------------------
          Venus (299), Arial (701), Umbriel (702), Titania (703),
          Oberon (704), Miranda (705), Cordelia (706), Ophelia (707),
          Bianca (708), Cressida (709), Desdemona (710), Juliet (711),
          Portia (712), Rosalind (713), Belinda (714), Puck (715),
          Uranus (799), Pluto (999), Charon (901)

       Also + east longitude (prograde exceptions): 
       --------------------------------------------
          Sun (10), Earth (399), Moon (301)

    All others are prograde and must be input with negative longitude east
of the adopted prime meridian. Since such sites are usually expressed in terms
of positive west longitude on maps, negative east longitude would be ...

                           ( West longitude - 360 )


INTERPRETING NON-EARTH OBSERVER TABLES
--------------------------------------

   When placing a site on a body other than the Earth, some definitions
become useful:

 Interfering body:
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   The largest other body in the system. Such a body can visually complicate
observations at the site due to its brightness or by covering up the target.
On the Earth, the "interfering body" is the Moon. On Io, it would be Jupiter.
On Mars, it would be Phobos (largest body, though unlikely to genuinely
interfere).  Mercury and Venus have no interfering bodies.

   Observer tables provide some optional quantities that can be used to
characterize the effect of the interfering body (or IB): how far is the target
from the IB in the plane-of-sky, is it obscured by the IB, what fraction of the
IB is lit by the Sun as seen from the observing site, and so on.

 Deflecting body:
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   This is the Sun PLUS the most massive object in the planet/satellite system
These two masses are used to compute the relativistic deflection of light that 
can change the apparent position of the target body.

 Other changes:
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   REFRACTION

     There are no refraction effects modeled for non-Earth sites. Any request
     for refraction is ignored and the refraction angle will be zero. This 
     affects rise-set determination on non-Earth bodies as well.

   AIRMASS

     There is no airmass model or airmass cut-off available for non-Earth 
     sites. Any request for airmass computation is ignored.

   APPARENT RA & DEC

     The origin of Right Ascension for apparent coordinates on NON-EARTH sites
     with rotational models is the meridian containing the Earth equinox of 
     J2000.0. Apparent declination is with respect to the particular body's 
     true equator-of-date.  This allows an observer to align axes with the pole
     and use the local apparent sidereal time output by this system to set the 
     RA origin and acquire the target.

     For objects lacking a pole & prime meridian rotational model (spacecraft
     and certain asteroids that may have been redefined as "major bodies"),
     the reference frame (ICRF or FK4/B1950.0) coordinate system is used to 
     compute apparent places. That is, apparent RA and DEC are defined with 
     respect to the Earth mean-equator and equinox of the frame epoch.

   TIME
 
     The print-time output by this system for observer tables (UT or TT) is
     the instantaneous time on Earth. For non-Earth sites, it is unrelated to 
     the rotation of the body. Local apparent solar time at the observing site
     can be requested, as can the instantaneous light time from Earth to the
     non-Earth site. 


LIMITATIONS OF NON-EARTH/MOON ROTATION MODELS
---------------------------------------------

   For bodies outside the Earth-Moon system, precession and nutation effects
are usually not known to high accuracy. Thus, the NON-Earth/Moon IAU rotation
models, used by this system to determine topocentric site motion relative to
the inertial frame as a function of time, are good to about 0.1 degree in the
present era.

   For the gas giants Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, IAU longitude is 
based on the "Set III" prime meridian rotation angle of the magnetic field. 
By contrast, pole direction (thus latitude) is relative to the body dynamical 
equator. There can be an offset between the magnetic pole and the dynamical 
pole of rotation.

   For many satellites and the planet Mercury, the official IAU pole direction 
was simply assumed perpendicular to the body's mean orbit plane, lacking better 
information. For many satellites in the IAU model, the rotation rate was
assumed equal to the mean orbital period.
   
   Some small satellite rotational models are strictly valid only at the time
of the Voyager spacecraft flyby; extrapolation to other times is hazardous.
Topocentric results for such bodies (610-614, for example) should be used
cautiously if at all. Results in these cases reflect only the best available
model, which is a suspect one.

   As rotation models are refined through observation of surface features by
visiting spacecraft (Cassini, etc.), Horizons will be updated to use the best
officially sanctioned models available.

    * After selecting an object, enter "e+" to produce an ephemeris
       format like the last one, without additional prompting. 

===============================================================================
                           SAVING PROGRAM SETTINGS

   Telnet (interactive) users may go through program options once, then save 
all settings for recall during future sessions. This can save time, if you find
yourself always changing certain defaults or routinely defining the same output
format each time you connect. Others in your organization may load and use the 
same pre-defined format settings by name. 

   To save program settings, go through the prompts and define the settings as
you require. Then return to the main "Horizons>" prompt. 

     #1)  Type "SAVE {NAME}", where {NAME} contains 1-12 characters.  
     #2)  Next time you telnet to Horizons, type "LOAD {NAME}".

   Your output preferences will then be loaded in as the new defaults.

   If you make a mistake or want to change a setting later, two commands are 
relevant: DELETE and SAVE 

   DELETE a macro with command "DELETE {NAME}". Alternatively, change specific
settings manually, then replace the stored  macro with a SAVE to an existing 
name.  Delete and replace operations require input of a confirming password. 
LOAD does not. Thus, anyone can use your settings if they know the macro name. 
Only those who know the password can change or delete a macro.

   Start/stop dates are also saved in the macro, as is observing location. 
You need only load the macro and select the target. Remaining defaults will be 
as defined in the format macro. If the macro is for an individual (personal 
use), you may want to set the e-mail address prior to saving. Otherwise don't, 
so users of the macro will be prompted for it in the future.

   A macro may be loaded, then specific settings overruled by responding to the
program prompts.  For example, if your last table prior to saving the macro was
a "vector" table, that table type will be saved as the default. 

   Settings for the other table types are saved as well so, to access them, 
manually respond to the prompt requesting table type, over-riding the macro's 
"vector" default on that issue.  Start and stop times are also macro settings 
that may commonly be overruled as necessary. 

   Ideally, macro names would be something clean and logical:

            "OBS670-1" for macro #1 for Observatory Code 670, etc. 

   ... but the name is up to you. 

   The use of macros may make it less likely to stumble upon new capabilities 
as they are added, though they will described here and in the system news,
as appropriate. 

===============================================================================
                             INTEGRATOR DISPLAY

     Comet and asteroid ephemerides are integrated from initial conditions
called "osculating elements". These describe the 3-dimensional position and
velocity of the body at a specific time. The integrator starts with this state
and takes small time steps, summing the perturbing forces at each step before 
taking another step. A variable order, variable step-size integrator is used 
to control error growth. In this way, the gravitational attraction of other 
major solar system bodies on the target body trajectory is taken into account.
 
     The integrator starts at the epoch, or time, of the osculating elements. 
It then integrates forward or backward, as necessary, to the start of the 
requested table. Once it reaches the table start time, it may have to reverse 
direction and go forward in time to generate the table. 

     Every 50th step will be displayed so the user can get some sense of the 
progress of the ephemeris. Direction reversals are also displayed. If output 
is requested at small time intervals, the integrator may proceed rapidly to 
the start of the table. There may then be long (apparent) pauses, as numerous 
interpolations within a given integration step are performed to compute states
at closely spaced print times.

     The last number on the integrator display line is the most recent step
size in days.

===============================================================================
                           SPECIFICATION OF TIME

ACCEPTED FORMATS:

     Time may be specified many ways in addition to the primary form
"YYYY-MMM-DD HH:MM".  Of particular note are Julian day number and day-of-year 
forms.  Examples are shown below.  Input start times may be specified to 
1/1000th of a second if the default output setting is changed from "minutes".

     Generally, if the input start time has more digits of precision specified 
than the selected output format, start time will be truncated to the 
appropriate level. For example, if a start time of 23:45:12.4 is specified, but
the output format is only set to minutes, start time will automatically be 
changed to 23:45(:00.000).

    The program will interpret other forms as well, but if you get too casual,
you may end up with a surprise interpretation.
 
    The program's time-span prompts indicate the earliest & latest dates that 
may be used for the selected target/center combination, as well as the type of
time assumed being input (UT, CT, or TT).

    For cartesian coordinates or osculating elements tables, only CT may be 
used.  For observer tables, output may be either UT or TT. TO CHANGE THE UT 
DEFAULT for observer tables, append a "TT" when entering START time. To switch 
back, append a "UT" to the start time.

    The three time systems are described as follows: 

       CT ("Coordinate Time"); typically for cartesian and osculating element 
           tables. The uniform time scale and independent variable of the 
           ephemerides.

       TT  ("Terrestrial (Dynamic) Time"), called TDT prior to 1991, used for
           observer quantity tables. This is proper time as measured by an 
           Earth-bound observer and is directly related to atomic time, TAI.
           TT periodically differs from CT by, at most, 0.002 seconds.

       UT  is Universal Time. This can mean one of two non-uniform time-scales 
           based on the rotation of the Earth. For this program, prior to 1962, 
           UT means UT1.  After 1962, UT means UTC or "Coordinated Universal 
           Time". Future UTC leap-seconds are not known yet, so the closest 
           known leap-second correction is used over future time-spans.


 TIME ZONE CORRECTIONS:
 ----------------------
 Output time-tags may also be in local civil time. When specifying start time,
 enter your time-zone correction in the format:
 
                     YYYY-Mon-Dy HH:MM UT{s}HH{:MM}
 ... where
 
    {s} ...  optional sign (+ or -). If unspecified, it is assumed "+".
    HH  ...  integer hours time-zone difference from UT
  {:MM} ...  optional minutes offset (usually 0)
 
 North American standard time (winter) zone corrections are as follows:
 
          Atlantic Standard Time (AST) =  UT-4 hours
          Eastern Standard Time  (EST) =  UT-5 hours
          Central Standard Time  (CST) =  UT-6 hours
          Mountain Standard Time (MST) =  UT-7 hours
          Pacific Standard Time  (PST) =  UT-8 hours
 
 If daylight savings is in effect (summer), add one hour to above offsets.
 
 For example, "1999-jun-2 12:30 UT-8" produces a table in Pacific Standard
 Time. A "-7" would provide Pacific Daylight Time (or MST, if it is winter).


 GREGORIAN AND JULIAN CALENDAR DATES:
 ------------------------------------

    Input calendar dates 1582-Oct-15 and after are taken to be expressed in the 
extended Gregorian calendar system. Prior dates are assumed to be in the Julian 
proleptic calendar. 

    Historically, not all regions switched calendars at the same time (or
even in the same century). Thus, the user must be aware of which calendar was 
in effect for a particular historical record. It should NOT be assumed this 
system's calendar automatically correlates with a date from an arbitrary 
historical document.

    Here is the progression near the calendar switch point:

       Calendar Type    Calendar Date   Julian Day Number
       -------------    -------------   -----------------
        Julian           1582-Oct-03        2299158.5
        Julian           1582-Oct-04        2299159.5 --->
         (skipped)      "1582-Oct-05"       2299160.5    |
         (skipped)      "1582-Oct-06"       2299151.5    |
         (skipped)      "1582-Oct-07"       2299152.5    |
         (skipped)      "1582-Oct-08"       2299153.5    |
         (skipped)      "1582-Oct-09"       2299154.5    |
         (skipped)      "1582-Oct-10"       2299155.5    |
         (skipped)      "1582-Oct-11"       2299156.5    |
         (skipped)      "1582-Oct-12"       2299157.5    |
         (skipped)      "1582-Oct-13"       2299158.5    |
         (skipped)      "1582-Oct-14"       2299159.5    |
        Gregorian        1582-Oct-15        2299160.5 <--- 
        Gregorian        1582-Oct-16        2299161.5 
        Gregorian        1582-Oct-17        2299162.5

    Note that Julian (calendar) dates are different than (and unrelated to)
Julian day numbers.

    Examination of this table shows that the date labels from Oct 5, 1582 
through Oct 14, 1582 don't exist. Of course, the days themselves do, as is
shown in the continuous Julian day number column; it's just a matter of what
one calls them. If you specify a non-existent calendar date label that was 
"skipped", this program will automatically use a day number, as shown above,
that maps into the previous Julian calendar system. For example, requesting
a date of 1582-Oct-14 (skipped) is the same as requesting the Julian calendar 
date 1582-Oct-04.

ANCIENT DATES:

    Objects 0-10, 199, 299, 301, 399 and 499 (planet barycenters, their
equivalents and the Sun & Moon) are available over a 3000 B.C. to A.D. 3000
interval. When specifying ancient calendar dates, this system requires input in
the "BC/AD" scheme.  If no "BC" marker is input with a calendar date, it is
assumed to be "AD".  Exceptions are AD years less than 100 which must have an
AD symbol in the date in order to be recognized as a valid year. For example,
"66ad-jan-27" will be accepted, but "66-Jan-27" cannot be parsed. 

    In this system, there are no negative years. The progression is as follows:

               Julian Day Number       Labeling-convention
                 (Jan 1 00:00)       BC/AD      Arithmetical 
               -----------------     -----      ------------
                   1720327.5          3bc           -2
                   1720692.5          2bc           -1
                   1721057.5          1bc            0
                   1721423.5          1ad            1
                   1721788.5          2ad            2

    From this, one can see that no days (in the arithmetical year "0", for 
example) are skipped in the BC/AD scheme, but they do have a different label 
than in the corresponding arithmetical system.

    Output observer-table lines begin with a 'b' in column 1, to indicate B.C.
dates, and a space (" ") to indicate A.D. dates.


OUTPUT STEPPING:
----------------

 Fixed time steps:

    Output time steps are specified as integers with some associated units 
from the set {days, hours, minutes}. Example responses to the prompt include
"30 days", "1 day", "10 min", and so on.  To get half day steps, specify
"12 hour". 

    It is possible to obtain output at less than 1 minute intervals. After 
specifying a start and stop time, give a positive integer as the "time-step", 
without giving units, such as "10".  This will divide the time span into 
10 parts. For example, if start and stop times are one hour (3600 seconds) 
apart, specifying a step of "240" will produce output every 15 seconds 
(3600/15 = 240 intervals). "3600" will produce output every second. 

    Rise/set and satellite eclipse circumstances may not be accurate to less 
than a minute since factors such as the primary's oblateness and atmosphere 
are not currently modelled.

 Calendar steps:

    If a step-size in units of "years" or "months" is specified, output steps
will follow the calendar based on the starting date.  

    For example, if the start is 2008-Feb-29, and output is requested at 
"1 year" steps, output will be returned only for Feb 29 calendar days in those
leap years having 29 days in Februrary. 

    If output is requested at "1 month" intervals, output will occur for every 
successive month on the 29th of that month.  If a start date on the 31st is 
requested, output will only occur for months having 31 days.

 Time-varying steps:

    Output is typically at fixed time intervals. However, observer tables may 
additionally be requested at time-varying steps based on an angular shift
specification. That is, "output only if the object has moved at least X
arcseconds in the plane-of-sky". 

    When specifying step-size, with the telnet or e-mail interfaces, respond 
with something like "VAR ####", where '####' is an integer from 60 to 3600
arcseconds. This will trigger output whenever the object's position is
predicted to be '####' arcseconds different from the current output step 
in the observer's plane-of-sky.

    To preserve system performance, the time-varying output mode uses a 
simple linear extrapolation to predict the time when the object should have 
moved the requested distance.  Due to non-linearities in the object's actual 
motion in the plane-of-sky, this projection can be off by .1 to 5 (or more) 
arcsecs. Thus the angular-motion print criteria you give should be considered 
approximate.

    Computed quantities will be exact for the given time in the output, but 
the particular output time may not be exactly that required for the requested 
angular change.

                              REFERENCE FRAMES

  It is necessary to adopt a commonly agreed-upon coordinate system for 
describing the position and velocity of an object in three-dimensional space. 
This program has two basic frames available:

  "J2000" refers to the frame of the current planetary ephemeris. This is 
closely aligned with the International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF). 
The planetary ephemeris coordinates differ from ICRF by at most 0.001 
arcseconds, while the ICRF is thought to differ from the FK5 optical catalog 
system by at most 0.01  arcseconds.

  The planetary ephemeris (and ICRF) coordinate directions are defined purely 
with respect to external radio sources (quasars), but can  be thought of as 
approximately corresponding to these basis directions:

        +Z coordinate is normal to Mean Earth Equator of Epoch J2000.0
        +X coordinate is parallel to Mean Earth Dynamical Equinox of 
            Epoch J2000.0
        +Y coordinate completes the right-handed system

   "B1950" selects an inertial reference frame based on Earth Mean-Equator 
and FK4 optical catalog Equinox of Epoch B1950.0 (FK4/B1950.0), where the 
Epoch of B1950.0 is the Julian date at the start of the Besselian year 
B1950.0 (2433282.42345905). The Fricke equinox correction at Epoch is applied.

===============================================================================
                              COORDINATE SYSTEMS
       
      CARTESIAN VECTORS and OSCULATING ELEMENTS may be requested in one of 
three available coordinates systems derived from the selected basic reference 
frame. These systems can be defined with respect to the reference frames 
(above) as follows:
 
  Earth mean equator and equinox of reference epoch
 
    Reference epoch: J2000.0 or B1950.0
    xy-plane: plane of the Earth's mean equator at the reference epoch
    x-axis  : out along ascending node of the instantaneous plane of the
              Earth's orbit and the Earth's mean equator at the reference epoch
    z-axis  : along the Earth mean north pole at the reference epoch
 
  Ecliptic and mean equinox of reference epoch
             
    Reference epoch: J2000.0 or B1950.0
    xy-plane: plane of the Earth's orbit at the reference epoch
    x-axis  : out along ascending node of instantaneous plane of the Earth's
              orbit and the Earth's mean equator at the reference epoch
    z-axis  : perpendicular to the xy-plane in the directional (+ or -) sense 
              of Earth's north pole at the reference epoch. 
 
  Body mean equator and node of date
 
    Reference epoch: "of date"
    Reference plane: ICRF or FK4/B1950.0
    xy-plane: central-body mean equator plane at reference epoch
    x-axis  : out along the ascending node of the central-body mean equator
              plane on the reference plane at the reference epoch
    z-axis  : along the central-body mean north pole at the reference epoch

OBSERVER TABLE COORDINATES, such as RA and DEC, may be with respect to two 
possible coordinate systems:

Earth mean equator and equinox of reference epoch (astrometric coordinates):

    Reference epoch: J2000.0 or B1950.0
    xy-plane: plane of the Earth's mean equator at the reference epoch
    x-axis  : out along ascending node of the instantaneous plane of the 
              Earth's orbit and the Earth's mean equator at the reference epoch
    z-axis  : along the Earth mean north pole at the reference epoch 

Body true equator and Earth equinox of date (apparent coordinates)
    Reference epoch: "of date"
    xy-plane: plane of the body's true equator at the reference epoch
    x-axis  : out along ascending node of instantaneous plane of the Earth's 
              orbit and the Earth's true equator plane at the reference epoch
    z-axis  : along the body's true north pole at the reference epoch

===============================================================================
                          SEARCHING FOR SMALL-BODIES

   Search for small-bodies with following keywords (Type R=real, I=integer, 
C=char). Use comparisons from the set { <, >, <>, = }. Separate each field with
a semi-colon. Example search formulation:
 
                   A < 2.5; IN > 7.8; STYP = S; GM <> 0;

The first group of keywords are common to asteroids AND comets: 

 Type     Keyword     Description
 ----     -------     -----------
  C       NAME ...... Asteroid OR comet name fragment
  C       DES ....... Object designation
  R       EPOCH ..... Julian Date of osculating elements
  R       CALEPO .... Calendar date of osc. elements; YYYYMMDD.ffff
  R       A ......... Semi-major axis (AU)
  R       EC ........ Eccentricity
  R       IN ........ Inclination of orbit plane (DEG) wrt ecliptic
  R       OM ........ Longitude of Ascending Node (DEG) wrt ecliptic/equinox
  R       W ......... Argument of Perihelion (DEG) wrt ecliptic/equinox
  R       TP ........ Perihelion Julian Date

  R       RAD ....... Object radius (KM)
  R       GM ........ Object GM (KM^3/S^2), only a few are known
  R       QR ........ Perihelion distance (AU)
  R       ADIST ..... Aphelion distance (AU)
  R       ANGMOM .... Specific angular momentum (AU^2/DAY)
  R       N ......... Mean motion (DEG/DAY)
  R       DAN ....... Heliocentric dist. (AU) of ascending node
  R       DDN ....... Heliocentric dist. (AU) of descending node
  R       L ......... Ecliptic longitude of perihelion (DEG)
  R       B ......... Ecliptic latitude of perihelion (DEG)
  I       NOBS ...... Number of astrometric determinations in solution
  C       SOLN ...... Solution ID

The next parameters are ASTEROID SPECIFIC. If one or more is used, the search
will conclude faster by examining asteroids only. For example, including
something like 'H > -10;' will limit the search to asteroids only:

  C       ASTNAM .... Asteroid name fragment (designation if unnamed)
  R       B-V ....... B-V color (asteroid)
  R       H ......... Absolute magnitude parameter (asteroid)
  R       G ......... Magnitude slope parameter; can be < 0 (asteroid)
  R       ROTPER .... Rotational period, hrs (asteroid)
  R       ALBEDO .... Geometric albedo (asteroid)
  C       STYP ...... Spectral type, Tholen scheme (asteroid)

The next parameters are COMET SPECIFIC. If one or more is used, the search
will conclude faster by examining comets only. For example, including something
like "M1 > -10;' will limit the search to comets only:

  C       COMNAM .... Comet name fragment (designation if unnamed)
  I       COMNUM .... Comet number
  R       M1 ........ Total absolute magnitude (comet)
  R       M2 ........ Nuclear absolute magnitude (comet)
  R       K1 ........ Total magnitude scaling factor (comet)

  R       PHCOF ..... Phase coefficient for k2=5 (comet)
  R       A1 ........ Radial non-grav accel (comet), 10^-8 AU/DAY^2
  R       A2 ........ Transverse non-grav accel (comet), 10^-8 AU/DAY^2
  R       A3 ........ Normal non-grav accel (comet), AU/d^2
  R       DT ........ Non-grav lag/delay parameter (comet), days

  Only 1 of the 4 keywords 'ASTNAM', 'COMNAM', 'NAME' or 'DES' can be 
specified on a given search.
 
Directives:
-----------

There are 5 special directives that may be used to limit or control searches:
 
     Directive  Description
     ---------  -----------
     COM .....  Limit search to comets only

     AST .....  Limit search to asteroids only

     LIST ....  Display parameter values for matched objects. (This may be
                 set as a default for all subsequent searches by typing "LIST"
                 at the main system prompt, "Horizons>".)

                For example,
                 "A < 2.5; IN > 10; AST;"        (match parameters against 
                                                  asteroids ONLY)
                 "A < 2.5; IN > 10; AST; LIST;"  (match AND display values 
                                                  of the parameters)

     NOFRAG ..  Exclude/skip comet fragments

     CAP .....  A filter that guarantees only one comet apparition will be 
                 returned for each comet. It may be used three ways:

                 CAP;        (returns last apparition before the current date)
                 CAP < JD#;  (returns last apparition before the specified 
                               Julian Day Number)
                 CAP < YEAR; (returns last apparition before the given integer
                               year)

                If the number after a '<' is less than 10000, it is assumed 
                to be a year integer. Otherwise, the number is taken to be 
                a Julian Day Number.  If "CAP;" is specified, the search is 
                automatically recognized as being a comets-only search.
 

Contents of Small-body Database & Update Frequency:
---------------------------------------------------

    Excluded from the database are single opposition asteroids with 
observational data arcs less than 30 days, unless they are NEO's, "PHA's" or 
radar targets (which ARE included). Everything else is in. 
 
    Except for "PHA's" and NEOs, which are usually included within a couple 
hours of announcement, there can be a delay of a few days to a couple weeks 
before newly discovered objects (that meet the filter criteria) are added. 
Users can input their own objects, as described in the next section. The 
database is updated hourly with new objects and orbit solutions. 

===============================================================================
                          USER-SPECIFIED SMALL-BODIES
       
    It is possible to define an object not in the database by inputting its
HELIOCENTRIC ECLIPTIC elements and some other parameters. Type ';' at the main 
prompt. It is also possible to display a database object, then "cut-and-paste" 
elements back into the program, varying parameters (such as magnitude), as 
needed.  Cut-and-paste is a function of your local terminal capability.

  PRESS <return> ON A BLANK LINE WHEN DONE. Input format is:   
 
          LABEL= VALUE LABEL= VALUE ...
          LABEL= VALUE ...
            .
            .

... where acceptable label strings are defined as follows:
       EPOCH ....  Julian ephemeris date (CT) of osculating elements
       EC .......  Eccentricity
       QR .......  Perihelion distance in (AU)
       TP .......  Perihelion Julian date
       OM .......  Longitude of ascending node (DEGREES) wrt ecliptic
       W ........  Argument of perihelion (DEGREES) wrt ecliptic
       IN .......  Inclination (DEGREES) wrt ecliptic

Instead of {TP, QR}, {MA, A} or {MA,N} may be specified (not both):
       MA .......  Mean anomaly (DEGREES)
       A ........  Semi-major axis (AU)
       N ........  Mean motion (DEG/DAY)

Note that if you specify elements with MA, {TP, QR} will be computed from
them. The program always uses TP and QR internally.

OPTIONAL INPUTS
---------------
       RAD ......  Object radius (KM)
       AMRAT ....  Area-to-mass ratio (m^2/kg). Setting to a non-zero value
                    activates calculation of solar radiation pressure
                    acceleration. Total absorption is assumed, so scale the
                    value to account for reflectivity. For example, if 15% 
                    of light is reflected, specify a value for AMRAT for
                    which the actual value is multiplied by 1.15.

  For asteroids, additional OPTIONAL parameters can be given:
       H ........  Absolute magnitude parameter (asteroid)
       G ........  Magnitude slope parameter; can be < 0 (asteroid)

  For comets, additional OPTIONAL parameters can be given:
       M1 ........ Total absolute magnitude (comet)
       M2 ........ Nuclear absolute magnitude (comet)
       K1 ........ Total magnitude scaling factor (comet)
       K2 ........ Nuclear magnitude scaling factor (comet)
       PHCOF ..... Phase coefficient for k2=5 (comet)
       A1 ........ Radial non-grav accel (comet), AU/DAY^2
       A2 ........ Transverse non-grav accel (comet),  AU/DAY^2
       A3 ........ Normal non-grav accel (comet), AU/d^2
       DT ........ Non-grav lag/delay parameter (comet), days.

  You may enter each value on a separate line or several on one line.  If you
make a mistake, re-entering the label on another line will over-ride the
previously specified value.  To erase a value, enter something like "H=", 
where no value is given. To cancel all input, enter "-" as the first character
on a line. To log-out, enter a "q" or "x" as first character on a line. 

  When done, after having pressed <return> on a blank line, you will be asked 
whether the reference frame of the elements is FK5/J2000.0 or FK4/B1950.0.
You will also be asked the object name.

Example input:

 EPOCH= 2450200.5
  EC= .8241907231263196 QR= .532013766859137 TP= 2450077.480966184235
  OM= 89.14262290335057 W = 326.0591239257098 IN= 4.247821264821585

===============================================================================
                       CUSTOMIZING REQUESTED EPHEMERIDES

   Keys are embedded in output ephemerides to assist with automated reading of
the output by user's own software. The keys are defined as follows:

                         $$SOE    Start of ephemeris
                         $$EOE    End of ephemeris

   Ephemerides may be customized by changing output default flags.  The '*' 
symbols below denote login defaults. All tables may be optionally output in a 
"comma-separated-value" format for import into spreadsheets.

3. Observer table
   --------------

        Any object with respect to geocentric or topocentric observer, including

        Default quantities. Always output:
           Time
           Solar-presence
           Lunar-presence

        Selectable quantities. Output in order requested.  No initial default 
        exists. You will be prompted at least once. A detailed definition of
        these values follows, with the '*' symbols marking those quantities
        affected by user selection of airless or refraction-corrected apparent
        quantities. Quantities preceded by a '>' are statistical uncertainties 
        that can be computed for asteroids and comets if a covariance is 
        available, either in the database or supplied by the user.  Number 
        assignments could change if new quantities are added:

  A = All quantities      B = Geocentric only        C = Small-body geocentric
  D = Small-body topo.    E = Spacecraft geocentric  F = Spacecraft topocentric
 
  The alphabetic assignments specifically mean:
  A = 1-40                       B = 1-3,6,9-33        C = 1-3,9-11,13,18-29,

      33-34,36-40

  ... with the small-body cases primarily skipping cartographic dependent
quantities. Note that Ida and Gaspra are exceptions, having IAU-defined
mapping grids, so that C & D options won't provide all available data for such 
objects. In the list below, '*' indicates initial program default settings.

        Reference coordinate frame:

                   DEFINITION OF OBSERVER TABLE QUANTITIES


  The menu of observer table output quantities was shown above. The format of 
the table is as follows. "Labels" refers to column headings at the start of 
the table:
 
TIME
  One output line for each step. The line begins with a 'b' if the date is BC,
a blank (" ") if AD. This is followed by the date and time, which is either
UT or TT, in calendar or JD format (or both), depending on user defaults.

SOLAR PRESENCE
  Time tag is followed by a blank, then a solar-presence symbol:
          
        '*'  Daylight (refracted solar upper-limb on or above apparent horizon)
        'C'  Civil twilight/dawn
        'N'  Nautical twilight/dawn
        'A'  Astronomical twilight/dawn
        ' '  Night OR geocentric ephemeris 

INTERFERING BODY/LUNAR PRESENCE
  The solar presence symbol is immediately followed by another marker symbol:

        'm'  Refracted upper-limb of Moon/IB on or above apparent horizon
        ' '  Refracted upper-limb of Moon/IB below apparent horizon OR 
              geocentric ephemeris
        'r'  Rise    (target body on or above cut-off RTS elevation)
        't'  Transit (target body at or past local maximum RTS elevation)
        's'  Set     (target body on or below cut-off RTS elevation)

  The 'rts' codes will be displayed under two conditions only: if the print 
interval is less than or equal to 30 minutes or the RTS-only print option has 
been selected.

  For non-Earth observing sites, no twilight/dawn codes (C, N, or A) are
output, refraction is not modelled and the interfering body marker is 'x'
instead of the 'm' reserved for Earth's Moon.

STATISTICAL UNCERTAINTIES

  Output for asteroids and comets can include formal +/- 3-standard-deviation 
statistical orbit uncertainty quantities. There is a 99.7% chance the actual 
value is within given bounds.  These statistical calculations assume 
observational data errors are random. If there are systematic biases (such as 
timing, reduction, or star-catalog errors), results can be optimistic. Because 
the epoch covariance is mapped using linearized variational partial 
derivatives, results can also be optimistic for times far from the solution 
epoch, particularly for objects having close planetary encounters.

NOTE: "n.a." is output if a requested quantity is not available for selected 
      object. For example, azimuth and elevation for a geocentric ephemeris,
      or uncertainties for an object with no covariance in the database.


SPECIFIC QUANTITIES

  1. Astrometric RA & DEC: 
        Corrected for light-time only. With respect to the Earth mean equator 
        and equniox of the reference Epoch. If FK4/B1950.0 frame output is 
        selected, elliptic aberration terms are added.

        Labels:  R.A._(ICRF/J2000.0)_DEC  (HMS/DMS format)
                 R.A._( FK4/B1950.0)_DEC  (HMS/DMS format)

        Apparent right ascension and declination of the target with respect
     to the center/site body's true-equator and Earth equinox of-date. For
     non-Earth sites with rotational models, the origin of RA is the meridian 
     containing the Earth equinox of J2000.0. For non-Earth sites without 
     rotational models, RA and DEC are with respect to the REFERENCE FRAME
     (FK4/B1950 or ICRF/J2000.0) coordinate system. Corrected for light-time, 
     the gravitational deflection of light, stellar aberration, precession and 
     nutation. There is an optional (approximate) correction for atmospheric 
     refraction (Earth only).

        Labels:  dRA*cosD d(DEC)/dt

  4. Apparent AZ & EL:
        Apparent azimuth and elevation of target. Corrected for light-time, 
     the gravitational deflection of light, stellar aberration, precession and

     refraction (Earth only). Azimuth measured North(0) -> East(90) -> 
     South(180) -> West(270). Elevation is with respect to plane perpendicular
     to local zenith direction.  TOPOCENTRIC ONLY. Units: DEGREES

        Labels:  Azi_(a-appr)_Elev  (airless)
                 Azi_(r-appr)_Elev  (refracted)

  5. Rates; AZ & EL
        The rate of change of target apparent azimuth and elevation (airless). 
     d(AZ)/dt is multiplied by the cosine of the elevation angle. TOPOCENTRIC 
     ONLY. Units are ARCSECONDS PER MINUTE.

        Labels:  dAZ*cosE d(ELV)/dt

  6. X & Y satellite offset & position angle
        Satellite differential coordinates WRT the central body along with the
     satellite position angle. Differential coordinates are defined in RA as
          X=[(RA_sat - RA_primary)*COS(DEC_primary)],
     and in DEC as
          Y=(DEC_sat-DEC_primary). 
     Non-Lunar satellites only. "SatPANG" is CCW angle from the North Celestial
     Pole to a line from planet center to satellite center.
     Units: ARCSECONDS (X & Y) and DEGREES (position angle)

        Labels:  X_(sat-primary)_Y SatPANG

  7. Local Apparent Sidereal Time
        The angle measured westward in the body true-equator of-date plane 
     from the meridian containing the body-fixed observer to the meridian 
     containing the true Earth equinox (defined by intersection of the true 
     Earth equator of date with the ecliptic of date). For non-Earth sites,
     a somewhat different definition is used. The value returned is measured
     from the observer meridian to the meridian containing the Earth equinox 
     of the J2000.0 system. TOPOCENTRIC ONLY. Units are HH MM SS.ffff or 
     decimal hours (HH.ffffffffff) 

        Labels:  L_Ap_Sid_Time

  8. Airmass
        RELATIVE optical airmass; a measure of extinction. The ratio between
     the absolute optical airmass at the target's refracted position to the 
     absolute optical airmass at zenith. Based on work of Kasten and Young 
     (Applied Optics, vol. 28 no. 22, 15-Nov-1989). AVAILABLE ONLY FOR 
     TOPOCENTRIC EARTH SITES WITH THE TARGET ABOVE THE HORIZON.  Unitless.

  9. Vis mag. & Surf Bright
        Approximate (apparent) visual magnitude & surface brightness, where
     surface brightness is the average visual magnitude of a square-arcsecond 
     of the illuminated portion of the apparent disk). 

     Planets & satellites: Value for Pluto includes Charon. The Sun's altitude 
      above the Saturn ring-plane is not considered for Saturn.  When the Moon 
      is at phase angles < 7 deg.  (within 1 day of full), the computed 
      magnitude tends to be ~ 0.12 too small.  For observing sites not on the 
      Earth or Moon, planet and satellite magnitudes are not available (but 
      Sun, comet and asteroid values are). For planets and satellites, values 
      are available only for solar phase angles in the range generally visible 
      from Earth. This is to avoid extrapolation of models beyond their valid 
      (data-based) limits.

     Asteroids & comets: Surface brightness is returned for asteroids only 
      if a radius is known. Magnitudes are, in principle, accurate to about
      +/- 0.1 magnitude. However, measurement and calibration issues mean 
      values should be treated as uncertain at the +/- 1.0 magnitude level. 
      In practice, for solar phase angles > 90 deg, the error could exceed 
      1 magnitude. No values are output for phase angles greater than 120 
      degrees, since the errors could be large and unknown. 

     Units are (none) and VISUAL MAGNITUDES PER SQUARE ARCSECOND.

     body center and the center of a potential visually interfering body (such 
     as the Moon but, more generally, the largest body in the system except for

                           CLOSE-APPROACH TABLES

  For asteroids and comets, a close-approach table may be requested. Output 
is produced only when the selected object reaches a minimum distance within a
set spherical radius from a planet, Ceres, Pallas, or Vesta.
  
  User-specifications for this table can include the time-span to check, the 
radius of detection for planets and asteroids, the maximum uncertainty in 
time-of-close-approach before the table is automatically cut-off, and whether
to output optional error ellipse information projected into the B-plane

  The B-plane mentioned above is defined by the three orthogonal unit vectors 
T, R, and S (the origin being the body center). T lies in the B-plane, pointing
in the direction of decreasing celestial longitude. R lies in the B-plane, 
pointing in the direction of decreasing celestial latitude (south). S is 
directed along the relative velocity vector at body encounter, perpendicular 
to the B-plane, and thus R and T. The B vector is the vector in the plane from 
the body to the point where the incoming object's velocity asymptote pierces 
the R-T plane. Note the B-plane is defined only when the incoming object is 
hyperbolic with respect to the body.

  For objects with covariances, statistical quantities are output for each
close-approach. All tabulated statistical quantities (MinDist, MaxDist, TCA3Sg,
Nsigs and P_i/p) are based on a linearized covariance mapping in which 
higher-order (small) terms in the variational partial derivatives of the 
equations of motion are dropped. 

  Due to possible non-linearities in any given object's actual dynamics, this 
can result in significant errors at epochs distant in time from the solution 
epoch.  Consequently, long linearized mappings (thousands, or hundreds, or 
sometimes just dozens of years from the present time) should be considered 
approximate, pending additional analysis, especially in these cases:

           A) objects with numerous close planetary encounters (dozens), 
           B) objects with very close planetary encounters (< 0.01 AU),
           C) objects with very short data arcs (days or weeks).

  While linearized projections will tend to indicate such cases with obviously
rapid uncertainty growth, the specific numbers output can tend to understate 
orbit uncertainty knowledge. 

  Possible output quantities are described below. "Nominal" effectively means 
"highest-probability for the given orbit solution", although there can be other
possible orbits of equal probability. If there is no covariance, no statistical
quantities are returned.

 Date (CT) =
   Nominal close-approach date (Coordinate Time). Calendar dates prior to 
1582-Oct-15 are in the Julian calendar system.  Later calendar dates are 
in the Gregorian system.

 Body =
   Name or abbreviation of the planetary body or major asteroid being
closely approached by the selected small-body.

 CA Dist =
   Nominal close-approach distance at the close-approach time. Units: AU

 MinDist = 
   Minimum close-approach distance possible (formal 3 standard-deviations 
with linearized covariance mapping). Units: AU

 MaxDist =
   Maximum close-approach distance possible (formal 3 standard-deviations
with linearized covariance mapping). Units: AU

 Vrel =
   Relative velocity of the object and the body it is approaching at the
nominal time of close-approach. Units: KM/S

 TCA3Sg =
   Close-approach-time 3-standard deviation uncertainty.  Units: MINUTES

 SMaA   =
   3-sigma error ellipse semi-major axis projected into the B-plane at nominal
time of closest-approach. Units: KM

 SMiA   =
   3-sigma error ellipse semi-minor axis projected into the B-plane at nominal
time of closest-approach. Units: KM

 Gamma  =
   Orientation angle of error ellipse in the B-plane. Counter-clockwise 
angle from the B vector to the semi-major axis of the error ellipse. 
Units: DEGREES 

 Nsigs  =
   The number of standard deviations (sigmas) required for the error ellipse 
to intersect the body being closely approached. Units: STANDARD DEVIATIONS

 P_i/p  =
   Linearized probability of the object impacting the body.

                UNDERSTANDING RISE, TRANSIT AND SET INDICATORS

    There are 2 ways the system can be used to mark rise, transit and set (RTS)
conditions: activate the RTS-only print option OR produce a general observer 
table with step-size less than 30 minutes.

NORMAL_TABLE RTS-MARKER MODE

    RTS is indicated automatically during normal observer table generation,
when the step-size is less than 30 minutes. Markers are placed to indicate
the event occurred at some point in the previous step. Thus, precision of the 
indicator depends on the step-size selected. For this mode, rise and set are 
always with respect to the true-visual-horizon reference plane (TVH), described
below.

RTS-ONLY PRINT MODE 

    The advantage of this mode is it allows production of a more compact RTS 
table over a longer time-span than does the "normal" table generation mode.

    When RTS-only print is selected, the program will search for the events at 
a user-specified resolution, from 1 to 9 minutes. Output will be generated ONLY
for these three events. The marker symbols in the table indicate that the 
event took place sometime in the previous step interval. 

    This RTS-only mode can be turned on at two different points in the program:
         #1) Preferably, when specifying the ephemeris/search step-size
         #2) ... but also in the "change defaults" prompt structure

    Three types of criteria are available for the rise and set conditions,
relative to an input elevation angle (nominally 0 degrees). Select by 
specifying, when prompted at #1 or #2, one of these symbols:
 
        TVH ... True visual horizon plane. The horizon seen by an observer on 
                  the reference ellipsoid. Allows for horizon dip effect and 
                  refraction, but not local topography.
        GEO ... Geometric horizon plane. The horizon is defined by the plane 
                  perpendicular to the reference ellipsoid local zenith (no 
                  horizon dip).  Refraction is allowed for.
        RAD ... Radar case. Geometric horizon plane, no refraction.

    For example, when prompted for the step-size, one could enter "5 min GEO'
to search, at five-minute steps, for the refracted rise/set relative to the 
geometric horizon.

BACKGROUND DESCRIPTION

    Rise and set elevations are taken to be the maximum of 0 or the input
elevation cut-off value [0-90 deg], set in the "change defaults" prompt 
section. Thus, if there are local hills, one could set the cut-off at 10 
degrees and get RTS relative to that elevation.

    At low elevations, these rise/set times should be viewed as approximations,
realistically good to perhaps only 1-2 minutes at the horizon due to local 
atmospheric variation and topography. 

    To speed RTS-only searches, use the largest step-size compatible with the 
required accuracy. For example, considering the inherent atmospheric 
instability at the horizon, one should rarely need to identify rise/set to 
better than 5 minute accuracy. Setting a search-step of 5 minutes will then 
produce a table 5 times faster than 1 minute searching. 

    The program computes approximate refraction angles assuming yellow-light 
observations at 10 deg C sea-level with pressure of 1010 millibars. Corrected 
coordinates should be accurate to < 10 arcsec, but errors may be much larger 
near the horizon (+- 0.3 deg) or fluctuate unpredictably with local weather. 

    Both Moon and Sun rise/set are based on when the refracted upper limb
of the object reaches the specified elevation. Transit is based on the center
of the target body.

                             SPK File Generation            

 Introduction:
 -------------

   An SPK file is a binary file which may be smoothly interpolated to retrieve
an object's position and velocity at any instant within the file time-span.
Such files may be used as input to visualization and mission design programs, 
allowing them to quickly retrieve accurate target body observation and data
analysis ephemerides without having to repeatedly integrate equations of 
motion.   An SPK file could be considered a "recording" of the integrator.

   SPK stands for "Spacecraft and Planet Kernel". It is a file element of the 
SPICE system devised and maintained by the NAIF (Navigation and Ancillary 
Information Facility) team at JPL. SPK files may hold ephemerides for any kind
of spacecraft, vehicle or solar system body, but the SPK files produced by
Horizons are only for comets and asteroids.

   Potential users are advised that programming and science/math skills at an 
advanced college level are needed to utilize these files. Users must have a 
computer with 25-50 Mbytes of disk space, 8 Mbytes of available RAM and a 
FORTRAN or C compiler. The user's own code must be capable of calling FORTRAN 
or C modules. Internet FTP capability is needed to obtain the necessary SPICE 
components as well as the SPK files generated by Horizons.  

   For information on SPK files in general, contact
 
               Charles.H.Acton-Jr@jpl.nasa.gov (NAIF Team Leader)
 
   or see web site "http://pds-naif.jpl.nasa.gov/".

 Horizons Implementation:
 ------------------------

 IMPORTANT:

   These informal file releases should not be used for "category A" flight 
   project purposes (involving the safety and success of spacecraft hardware 
   and mission) without first contacting ... 

              Donald.K.Yeomans@jpl.nasa.gov 
              Supervisor, Solar System Dynamics Group, 818-354-2127
 
   A particular object's orbit may be insufficiently well-determined, over the
   chosen time-span, to be suitable for some high-precision purposes.

 Background:
 -----------

   SPK files can be produced only with the telnet interface. Horizons allows a
maximum of 20 small-bodies per SPK file. To construct an SPK for a comet or 
asteroid, Horizons integrates the object's trajectory over a user-specified 
time span greater than 32 days, but less than 200 years. The position 
components, at discrete steps, over some interval, are fit to a series of 
Chebyshev polynomials. When a users' application program reads the SPK file,
the appropriate polynomials are accessed and interpolated to retrieve the
requested state. 

   SPK files are capable of storing trajectory data with a fidelity greater 
than 1 millimeter (more accurately than should ever be required). In practice, 
it is the Chebyshev fit that determines how closely the SPK interpolation 
matches the integrator. The typical trade-off is that higher fidelity SPK files
are obtained by fitting higher degree polynomials to smaller time intervals.
The cost for increased accuracy is larger file size.
   
 File Fidelity:
 --------------

   Choosing the best way to represent a trajectory in a file is complicated
by the wide range of small-body orbits and anomalies such as close-approaches
to major planets.  Horizons seeks to strike a rough balance between file 
size and file fidelity, valuing fidelity more than file size. 

   Prior to the integration, a default mesh (state vector interval) is selected
for the polynomial fits.  There is the "loose" mesh for main-belt objects 
(eccentricity less than 0.35, semi-major axis greater than 2.3 AU). This covers
the majority of objects. Integrator states are preserved to the meter level or 
less (1-sigma) for most objects.

   There is a "standard mesh" that will fit all but a few objects well; 
close-approaches are described accurately to the 10-50 meter range and < 1 
meter at other times. File sizes are 4 times larger than "loose" mesh objects.

   Finally, for a few objects, a "tight" mesh will be necessary. File sizes
are 4x larger than "standard", 16x larger than "loose". 

   Mesh assignment is automatic, but not all cases requiring a tight mesh can 
be detected in advance (which is why this is being discussed). At the end of 
an integration, a summary of polynomial fit maximum errors is displayed: 

         ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
         A-posteriori SPK fidelity estimate (rel. to integrator):
              Max. error (3 std. dev)           Time
              ------------------------ ------------------------
           X: 0.7104212997280315D-03 m 1998-May-09 12:00:00.000 
           Y: 0.1287005692494599D-02 m 1998-May-09 12:00:00.000 
           Z: 0.7502616895491441D-03 m 1998-May-09 12:00:00.000 
         RSS: 0.1650446811753079D-02 m 1998-May-09 12:00:00.000 
         ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

   This shows the maximum three standard deviation error detected in the 
Chebyshev fit to the integrator position vector components. The maximum 
root-sum-square (RSS) of component error is also shown. If the error from the 
default mesh selection is too large for your application, contact 

                       Jon.D.Giorgini@jpl.nasa.gov  

for instructions on forcing Horizons to a tighter mesh and improving fidelity. 

   The above data, along with other summary information, is stored in the SPK
file comment area. It can be read using the "spacit" or "commnt" utility in 
the SPICE Toolkit distribution.

 Transferring SPK files:
 ----------------------
   Within the Horizons system, SPK files are created as binary files on a Sun 
 UltraSparc/UNIX platform. These files can be used on several popular 
 platforms, but may be unreadable on others. Reasons for this include:
 
            1) Data-type representation (machine word-size) 
            2) Floating point representations (IEEE or not)
            3) Byte order (least significant byte first vs. last)
 
   If you are using a verion of the SPICE Toolkit higher than 52, you will
 be able to directly read Horizons binary files on any platform. If not, the 
 machine you intend to use the SPK file on thus falls into one of two possible 
 categories:

 Compatible systems:
 -------------------
   If your system has 32-bit words, IEEE floating-point, and is "big-endian" 
 (stores highest order byte first) like the Sun UltraSparc, you will be able to
 use Horizons-generated binary SPK files directly; respond "no" to the 
 "transfer format" prompt and use the binary mode of FTP to retrieve the file. 
 Known compatible machines are the HP 9000 series, Motorola 68K series 
 (MacIntosh), Silicon Graphics and NeXT, among others. 
     
 Incompatible systems:
 ---------------------
    Known incompatible machines would be the Intel series (80486, Pentium, 
 etc.), DEC Alpha and VAX which have reversed byte-orders and/or non-IEEE 
 floating-point. To obtain an SPK for one of these platforms, respond "yes" 
 to the "transfer format" prompt.  The binary file will be converted to a
 transfer file. Once you FTP this file to your system, using FTP ASCII mode,
 you MUST run the program 'spacit' or 'tobin' (included in your SPICE Toolkit) 
 to produce a binary-compatible SPK for your machine.

                     STATEMENT OF EPHEMERIS LIMITATIONS 

     To produce an ephemeris, observational data (optical, VLBI, radar & 
spacecraft) containing measurement errors are combined with dynamical models 
containing modeling imprecisions.  A best fit is developed to statistically 
minimize those errors. The resulting ephemeris has an associated uncertainty 
that fluctuates with time.  

     For example, only a limited percentage of asteroid orbits are known to 
better than 1 arcsec in the plane-of-sky over significant periods of time. 
While 1991 JX center-of-mass was known to within 30 meters along the 
line-of-sight during the 1995 Goldstone radar experiment, errors increase 
outside that time-span. Uncertainties in major planet ephemerides range from 
10cm to 100+ km in the state-of-the-art JPL/DE-405 ephemeris, used as the basis
for spacecraft navigation, mission planning and radar astronomy.

     Cartesian state vectors are output in all their 16 decimal-place glory.  
This does not mean all digits are physically meaningful. The full-precision 
may be of interest to those studying the ephemerides or as a source of initial 
conditions for subsequent integrations.

     On top of this basic uncertainty, for osculating element output, GM is 
rarely known to better than 5 significant figures. 

     For observer angular output tables, purely local atmospheric conditions 
will affect "refraction-corrected" apparent places by several arcseconds, 
more at the horizon.

     Small-body elements are reported in the optical frame (i.e. FK5/J2000.0). 
This frame is currently thought to differ by no more than 0.01 arcseconds from 
the ICRF of the planetary ephemeris DE-405. Until a generally agreed upon 
transformation from one frame to the other is defined and implemented, they 
will be treated by this program as being the same.

     The Earth is assumed to be a rigid body and solid Earth tides affecting
station location are not included. Of course, precession and nutation effects 
are included, as is polar motion. CT-TAI terms less than 20 usec are omitted. 
These and other Earth-model approximations result in topocentric station 
location errors, with respect to the reference ellipsoid, of less than 
20 meters.  However, many optical site positions (latitude and longitude) are 
known far less accurately and can be many kilometers off.  

     Relativistic effects are included in all planet, lunar and small body
dynamics, excluding satellites. Relativity is included in observables via 2nd 
order terms in stellar aberration and the deflection of light due to gravity 
fields of the Sun (and Earth, for topocentric observers).

     Deflections due to other gravity fields can potentially have an effect at
the 10^-4 arcsec level but are not currently included here. Satellites of
other planets, such as Jupiter could experience deflections at the 10^-3 arcsec
level as well.  Light time iterations are Newtonian. This affects light-time 
convergence at the millisecond level, position at ~10^-6 arcsec level.

     For many small natural satellites, the orbit orientation is well known,
but the position of the body along the ellipse is not. Errors may be 
significant, especially for the lesser satellites of outer planets. Satellite 
osculating elements output by Horizons should NOT be used to initialize a 
separate integration or extrapolation. Such elements assume Keplerian motion 
(two point masses, etc.) which does not match, for example, kinematic models 
such as a precessing ellipse, used for some satellites. One would do better 
extrapolating mean orbital elements at http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sat_elem.html

     IF YOUR CAREER OR SPACECRAFT DEPENDS ON A NON-LUNAR NATURAL SATELLITE OR 
SMALL-BODY EPHEMERIS, CONTACT JPL BEFORE USING IT. YOU >MUST< HAVE ADDITIONAL
INFORMATION TO CORRECTLY UNDERSTAND EPHEMERIS LIMITATIONS AND UNCERTAINTIES.

===============================================================================
                             LONG-TERM EPHEMERIS

SOLAR SYSTEM MODEL:

     The JPL DE-406/LE-406 extended ephemeris covers the interval from 
3000 B.C. to A.D. 3000. This ephemeris is identical to the shorter DE-405 in 
the sense it is the same data-fit (solution) and the same numerical integration
as DE-405.  However, it has been stored with slightly less accuracy to reduce 
its size.

     For the Moon, DE-406 recovers the original integrator state to within 
1 meter, other bodies within 25 meters (maximum error). This difference can be 
less than the uncertainty associated with the trajectory solution itself, thus
is insignificant for all but the most specialized circumstances. The short-span
version, DE-405, recovers the integrator state to the millimeter level.

     Horizons uses the long-term DE-406/LE-406 for the following objects:

            Objects                      ID code #
            ---------------------------  -------------------
            All planet barycenters       0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 
            Sun                          10 
            Moon                         301 
            Mercury                      199
            Venus                        299
            Earth                        399
            Mars                         499

    Satellites and outer solar-system planet-centers each have various
shorter intervals, as warranted by their observational data arc.  Comets and 
asteroids are available only over the A.D. 1599 to A.D. 2200 interval of the 
DE-405 ephemeris they are integrated against. (Only a few dozen small-bodies
have sufficiently well-known orbits to justify rigorous integration over 
time-spans of hundreds of years.) 

PRECESSION MODEL:
  
    For the time-span of 1799-Jan-1 to 2202-Jan-1, the official IAU precession
model [16] of Lieske is used. As published, this model is valid for only ~200
years on either side of the J2000.0 epoch. This is due to round-off error in
the published coefficients and truncation to a 3rd order polynomial in the
expressions for the Euler rotation angles.  Therefore, outside this interval, 
the long-term precession and obliquity model [17] of Owen is used to maintain 
accuracy in the calculation of apparent ("of-date") quantities.

    This model is a rigorous numerical integration of the equations of motion
of the celestial pole using Kinoshita's model for the speed of luni-solar
precession.

NUTATION MODEL:

    The IAU (1980) model [18] of Wahr is used. This is the same table printed 
in the 1992 Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac. Note there is 
an error in the Explanatory Supplement for the Node term, given on p. 114 as:

                        OMEGA = 135deg 2'40.280" + ...

This system uses the correct formulation:

                        OMEGA = 125deg 2'40.280" + ... 


UNIVERSAL TIME (CT -> UT Conversion):

   This program internally uses the CT time-scale of the ephemerides (the 
independent variable in the equations of motion). To produce the more familiar 
Universal Time (UT) output tied to the Earth's rotation, it is necessary to 
use historical reconstructions of old or ancient observations of constrained 
events, such as eclipses, to derive a CT-UT difference. This program currently 
uses the analyses of [12-15] as follows:

    Span                   CT-UT offset  ("delta-t")   Type Argument (T=...)
    ---------------------  -------------------------- ----- -------------------
    3000 BC to  500 BC     (31*T*T) - 20                UT1 cent. since JD1820
    500 BC  to AD 1620     Stephenson cubic spline fit 
    AD 1620 to AD 1962     Smoothed table               UT1
    AD 1962 to Present     EOP file                     UTC

   Values prior to 1962 above are adjusted for compatibility with the Horizons 
planetary ephmeris lunar tidal acceleration (n_dot) of -25.7 "/century^2 as 
follows:

  delta_(CT-UTC) = -0.911*(n_dot + 26)*T*T, where T =  (year - 1955.5) / 100
 
        For epochs after 1962, the calculation is as follows:

                  CT - UTC = (CT - TAI) + (TAI - UTC)
... where
         
          CT  - TAI = 32.184 + 1.657E-3 * SIN( M + 0.01671*SIN(M) )
                  M = 6.239996 +  T * 1.99096871E-7
                  T = CT or TAI seconds past J2000.0 epoch

          TAI - UTC = interpolated from current EOP file.

... dropping terms less than about 20 usec in CT-TAI.

    As one progresses to earlier times, particularly those prior to the
1620 telescopic data span, uncertainties in UT determination generally 
(though not always and not uniformly) increase due to less precise 
observations and sparser records. At A.D. 948, uncertainty (not necessarily 
error) can be a few minutes.  At 3000 B.C., the uncertainty in UT is about 
4 hours.  The TT time scale, being uniform, does not have this uncertainty, 
but is not directly related to Earth's rotation (local time) either. 

GREENWICH MEAN SIDEREAL TIME:

    GMST, used for topocentric ephemerides, is related to UT1 using an 
expression consistent with the IAU 1976 system of constants, as shown 
on p. 50 of the Explanatory Supplement (1992), along with the new more 
accurate 1997 IAU equinox equation.

HIGH PRECISION EARTH ORIENTATION PARAMETER (EOP) MODEL
 
    The EOP file is currently updated twice a week based on GPS and other 
Earth-monitoring measurements. Horizons uses it to obtain calibrations for 
UT1-UTC, polar motion and nutation correction parameters necessary to determine
the rotation from the Earth-fixed reference frame to an inertial reference 
frame. The EOP file provides data from 1962 to the present, with predictions 
about 78 days into the future from the date of file release. For times outside 
the available interval, Horizons uses the last value available in the file as 
constants.  For CT-UT calculations, it switches to the different models 
described above.

    Because EOP values are fit to data, it is possible an ephemeris may differ 
slightly from one produced days or weeks or months later, especially, if the 
original ephemeris extended into the predicted region of the EOP file. The most 
recent ephemeris will be more accurate, but if it is necessary to reproduce 
results exactly, contact JPL. EOP files are archived and the one used in your 
initial run (indicated in your output) can be retrieved. Generally, any numeric
change will be very small and almost always negligible in a practical sense.

BODY ROTATIONS:
   
    The current IAU rotational models for the planets and satellites are
simply extended in time as necessary. 

===============================================================================
                                  BACKGROUND

   A) Comet and asteroid orbits are INTEGRATED from initial conditions stored
      in the JPL-maintained DASTCOM database.

   B) Planet and satellite ephemerides are INTERPOLATED from files previously
      generated by JPL, such as the DE-405 (or higher) planetary ephemeris.

   C) SMALL BODY DATA SCREENS are from the JPL DASTCOM database. These display
      constants ARE ACTUALLY USED to produce the ephemeris.

   D) MAJOR BODY DATA SCREEN CONSTANTS are from "Astrometric and Geometric
      Properties of Earth and the Solar System", Charles Yoder (JPL), published
      in "Global Earth Physics: A Handbook of Physical Constants", AGU
      Reference Shelf 1.

   E) MAJOR BODY DATA SCREEN CONSTANTS are presented for your information (FYI)
      only and ARE NOT USED to generate the ephemeris output (see below). While
      an effort has been made to insure their accuracy, suitability of these
      DISPLAY constants for any given purpose must be determined by individual
      users.   Users should be aware there is often more than one determination
      in the literature for many of these constants and that they are subject
      to revision as more data are accumulated.

   F) Horizons uses the current planetary ephemeris solved-for GM values when 
      calculating osculating elements. For DE-405/DE-406, they are as follows 
      (units are KM^3/SEC^2):

                        Sun              1.3271244001798698E+11

Constants and Model References 
------------------------------

     Major body (planet/satellite) GM and AU definitions ACTUALLY USED (as 
opposed to the FYI data screens) are from the DE-405 ephemeris, a major 
improvement over the earlier DE-200.  Other planet and satellite constants 
used by this software, such as radii, rotation and orientation, are based on 
the following sources:

         1.  `Report of the IAU/IAG Working Group on Cartographic

     Most values are from the `IAU/IAG Working Group on
     Cartographic Coordinates and Rotational Elements of the
     Planets and Satellites: 2000'.  The exceptions are:
 
         --   Radii for the Sun are from the above reference [2].
 
         --   The second nutation precession angle (M2) for Mars is
              represented by a quadratic polynomial in the IAU2003 report. 
              Current software cannot handle this term (which is extremely 
              small), so the polynomial is truncated to a linear one.
 
         --   The expressions for the pole and prime meridian of Neptune 
              given in the IAU report include trigonometric terms which 
              current software doesn't yet handle.  These terms are omitted.
 
         --   For several satellites, the IAU2003 report either gives a 
              single radius value or a polar radius and a single equatorial
              radius.  Current software uses a triaxial ellipsoid model that 
              requires three radii. In the cases listed below, additional 
              values have been supplied in order to allow the software to 
              function.
